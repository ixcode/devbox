# DEVBOX

A consistent dev environment that is built using vagrant and virtual box. The idea being that we can get a scripted, simple dev environment running on a locked down base OS, e.g. windows.

Current versions built on OS X Virtual Box 5.0.

Available host OS:

- Centos 7
- TODO - Ubuntu

Would be interesting to try OS X inside OS X
